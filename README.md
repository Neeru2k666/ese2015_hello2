Dear ESE Team

This project has been developed with the standard Java technology stack (Java EE7 and JSF). Most of Spring's core features
used in the provided example (or in general) have been incorporated into standard Java EE. 

Regarding JSP vs JSF: I find JSF much easier to use (and learn) than JSP with all its controllers, complex EL and so on. JSF furthermore
allows to integrate UI Frameworks such as PrimeFaces to enhance user friendliness, usability and adds state of the art AJAX functionality.

The project has been built in NetBeans and uses GlassFish 4.1 as WebContainer. The database used is the standard java derby database 
provided by Glassfish. Both, GlassFish and DB run out of the box, no configuration needed.

The project was created as maven project from an archetype (javaee7-essentials-archetype). This archetype has been developed
by Adam Bien (http://about.adam-bien.com/), whom's philosophy I tend to follow.
